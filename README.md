# More Mountains
Adds two new shrines to the game: the Crimson Shrine of the Mountain and the Amber Shrine of the Mountain.

These shrines function similarly to Shrine of the Mountain, although they provide rewards from tiers corresponding to their color rather than additional green rewards. They also add increased difficulty to the teleporter event by adding more director credits than a normal mountain activation would. These values are configurable.

These shrines **do not spawn on their own**, but instead have a chance to replace a normal Shrine of the Mountain spawn. This chance is configurable.

## Default Behavior
Crimson Shrine of the Mountain
* 10% chance to replace normal Shrine of the Mountain (configurable)
* Adds 500% director credits to the teleporter event (configurable)
* Adds 1 red item to the teleporter rewards per player (**not configurable**)

Amber Shrine of the Mountain
* 10% chance to replace normal Shrine of the Mountain (configurable)
* Adds 400% director credits to the teleporter event (configurable)
* Adds 1 yellow item to the teleporter rewards per player (**not configurable**)

## Known Issues
* These shrines may not be affected by other mods that modify Shrine of the Mountain's behavior (to be clear nothing should *break*). I intend to address this as best as I can as I find different compatibility issues.
* Currently incompatible with Artifact Of Potential due to how that mod hooks.

## Potential Future Work
* Add Snowy/Sandy variants of shrines
* Additional Shrines - plan to add Void and Lunar Shrines in the future
* Additional Impact of Shrine beyond increasing the credit cost for added/varying difficulty
* Change mountain shrine icon display color over the teleporter
* Working on compatibility with other mods that affect Shrine of the Mountain. Please reach out to me if you notice issues here with your mod or others!
* Open to suggestions!
